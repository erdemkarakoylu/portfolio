    "text": "I am currently a Data Scientist at Research Innovations Inc (RII), where my various projects span a number of topics including sentiment analysis, directed sentiment analysis, fake news detection, uncertainty estimation in deep learning, graph analytics, and graph neural networks. For the past 10 years, my goto programming language for these and other analytics and modeling tasks has been Python, though I sometimes fire up R studio to code up some quick statistical analysis in R.\nBefore RII I was a scientific programmer at the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group, where I cut my teeth coding up Bayesian models to estimate the prediction uncertainty for a variety of satellite processing algorithms. These algorithms are the backbone of product generation for data generated by legacy and active satellite missions, as well as the PACE (Plankton Aerosol Cloud Ecosystem) mission scheduled to begin in 2024.\nPrior to my analytics/data science career, I trained as an oceanographer. I graduated with a PhD from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, where I primarily focused on the ecology of tiny organisms that nevertheless are tremendously important in ocean ecological processes and have ramifications for both our supply of seafood (protein!) as well as climate change."
