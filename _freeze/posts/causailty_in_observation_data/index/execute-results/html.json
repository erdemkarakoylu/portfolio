This is because there can be many potential confounders, not all of which might be identified. By confounder I mean \"a variable whose presence affects the variables being studied so that the results do not reflect the actual relationship\" ([*Pourhoseingholi et al. 2012*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24834204/)*.*)\n\nThis project illustrates the use of matching and propensity score to establish a causal link beween treatment and outcome in an observational study. The data comes from a study published by *Lalonde (1986)*; a pdf of which is available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4900843_Evaluating_the_Econometric_Evaluations_of_Training_Programs_with_Experiment_Data). The goal of the study was to evaluate the impact of an employment and training program.

This is however not without drawbacks; most importantly the resulting p-value will depend on the sample size.\n",
