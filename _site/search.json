    "text": "Establishing causality between an intervention, such as a treatment, and an outcome is best done under conditions where all possible factors that may affect the outcome can be controlled for; what is referred to as Randomized Control Trials (RCT.)\nEstablishing causal link in observational studies can be quite challenging. This is because there can be many potential confounders, not all of which might be identified. By confounder I mean “a variable whose presence affects the variables being studied so that the results do not reflect the actual relationship” (Pourhoseingholi et al. 2012.)\nThis project illustrates the use of matching and propensity score to establish a causal link beween treatment and outcome in an observational study by Lalonde (1986); a pdf of the paper is available here. The goal of the study was to evaluate the impact of an employment and training program. The data I use here is a subset of the data generated by this study; it includes 614 observations in total with 10 variables. This data is included in Matching; one of the libraries I use for this project. The data is loaded as follows.\nlibrary(Matching)\n\ndata(lalonde)\nThe loaded data includes a number of covariates, an outcome variable and a treatment flag indicating whether the subject was part of the control or the treatment group.

    "text": "I am currently a Data Scientist at Research Innovations Inc (RII), where my various projects span a number of topics including sentiment analysis, directed sentiment analysis, fake news detection, uncertainty estimation in deep learning, graph analytics, and graph neural networks. For the past 10 years, my goto programming language for these and other analytics and modeling tasks has been Python, though I sometimes fire up R studio to code up some quick statistical analysis in R.\nBefore RII I was a scientific programmer at the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group, where I cut my teeth coding up Bayesian models to estimate the prediction uncertainty for a variety of satellite processing algorithms. These algorithms are the backbone of product generation for data generated by legacy and active satellite missions, as well as the PACE (Plankton Aerosol Cloud Ecosystem) mission scheduled to begin in 2024.\nPrior to my analytics/data science career, I trained as an oceanographer. I graduated with a PhD from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, where I primarily focused on the ecology of tiny organisms that nevertheless are tremendously important in ocean ecological processes and have ramifications for both our supply of seafood (protein!) as well as climate change."
